#
# This is the main Apache HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/> for detailed information.
#
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do not add a slash at the end of the directory path.  If you point
# ServerRoot at a non-local disk, be sure to specify a local disk on the
# Mutex directive, if file-based mutexes are used.  If you wish to share the
# same ServerRoot for multiple httpd daemons, you will need to change at
# least PidFile.
#
# NOTES: The Ubuntu packaged Apache 2.2 doesn't use this directive instead
# it relies on environment variables (or -d parameter) during startup. In
# this set of config files we define it. This should be set to the same 
# location you used for --prefix given to the ./configure script.
#
ServerRoot "/opt/apache24"

#
# These need to be set in /opt/apache24/conf/envvars
#
PidFile ${APACHE_PID_FILE}
Mutex default:${APACHE_LOCK_DIR}
User ${APACHE_RUN_USER}
Group ${APACHE_RUN_GROUP}

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 300

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
KeepAliveTimeout 5

#
# How the server identifies itself in the headers
# http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#servertokens
# You should use Minimal, OS or Full
#
# TraceEnable Off technically makes the server non-compliant but there
# are POTENTIALLY security concerns with having TRACE enabled. To be
# compliant I've enabled it here but then disabled it in local.conf.
#
ServerTokens Minimal
ServerSignature Off
TraceEnable On

#
#
# CoreDumpDirectory: define to enable core dumps must be writable by user
# GracefulShutdownTimeout: seconds to wait after graceful stop (0=infinite)
# Listen: see ports.conf file which lists the Listen directives
# ListenBackLog: length of pending connections (default: 511)
# MaxConnectionsPerChild: number of connections per child process which
#                         can prevent memory leakage if set to non-zero
#                         remember with KeepAlive On this is really
#                         MaxKeepAliveRequests * MaxConnectionsPerChild
#                         (old name was MaxRequestsPerChild)
# MaxMemFree: max amount of memory allowed to be held KBytes (default: 2048)
# MaxRequestWorkers: simultaneous connection processing (was MaxClients)
#                    for event MPM is ServerLimit * MaxRequestWorkers threads
# MaxSpareThreads: reduced to 75 to reduce memory usage (default: 250)
# MinSpareThreads: reduced to 25 to reduce memory usage (default: 75)
# PidFile: is defined higher in this config file (not MPM specific)
# ReceiveBufferSize: TCP receive buffer size (0=OS default)
# ScoreBoardFile: server child communication (usually done in shared memory)
# SendBufferSize: TCP buffer size (0=OS default)
# ServerLimit: upper limit on the number of configurable processes
#              this must be greater than MaxRequestWorkers / ThreadsPerChild
#              default is 16 for work and event 
# StartServers: the event MPM is based of worker which defaults to 3
# ThreadLimit: upper limit on number of threads per child process
# ThreadsPerChild: constant number of worker threads in each server process
# ThreadStackSize: size in bytes of the stack used by threads handling connections
#
GracefulShutdownTimeout		0
MaxConnectionsPerChild		0
MaxMemFree					2048
MaxRequestWorkers			400
MaxSpareThreads				75
MinSpareThreads				25

#
# AccessFileName: Where to look for addition configuration directives.
# This file and associated .htpasswd files should not be accessible.
# NOTE: The authz_core and authz_host modules are built statically.
#
AccessFileName .htaccess
<Files ".ht*">
	Require all denied

#
# Default mime type should be None for 2.2.7 onwards use mime.types instead
#
DefaultType None

#
# HostnameLookups: Log the names of clients or just their IP addresses
# e.g., www.apache.org (on) or 204.62.129.132 (off).
# The default is off because it'd be overall better for the net if people
# had to knowingly turn this feature on, since enabling it means that
# each client request will result in AT LEAST one lookup request to the
# nameserver.
#
HostnameLookups Off

#
# UseCanonicalName: Determines how Apache constructs self-referencing 
# URLs and the SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT variables.
# When set "Off", Apache will use the Hostname and Port supplied
# by the client.  When set "On", Apache will use the value of the
# ServerName directive.
#
UseCanonicalName Off

#
# EnableMMAP and EnableSendfile
# Becuase we're expecting IPv6 sendfile may cause TCP-checksum errors
# so disabling it; but enabling MMAPing for the efficiency improvement.
# Defaults: EnableMMAP On, EnableSendfile Off
#
EnableMMAP On
EnableSendfile Off

#
# ErrorLog: The location of the error log file.
# If you do not specify an ErrorLog directive within a <VirtualHost>
# container, error messages relating to that virtual host will be
# logged here.  If you *do* define an error logfile for a <VirtualHost>
# container, that host's errors will be logged there and not here.
#
ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log

#
# LogLevel: Control the number of messages logged to the error_log.
# Possible values include: debug, info, notice, warn, error, crit,
# alert, emerg.
#
LogLevel warn

#
# LogFormat's borrowed from Ubuntu however listed before the modules
# and server local.conf file because the log_config module has been
# built statically and so these can be overwritten in local.conf.
#
# NOTE: We have remove the logio %O component from these entries but
# by default mod_logio is enabled in modules.d/modules.load so these
# will be re-added in modules.d/logio.conf. If you don't need IO logs
# then disable mod_logio and the statements below will be used.
#
LogFormat "%v:%p %h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" vhost_combined
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-Agent}i\"" combined
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s" common
LogFormat "%{Referer}i -> %U" referer
LogFormat "%{User-agent}i" agent

#
# Define global access logs which will be used unless a <VirtualHost/>
# block changes the CustomLog destination. NOTE: With many virtual hosts
# you may reach a file limit constraint if each host has a separate log
# file - you can use split-logfile to decompose one combined log file.
