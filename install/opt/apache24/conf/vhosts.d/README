Apache 2.4 Varnished CHROOTED PHP-FPM WordPress Virtual Host

The virtual host configuration script provided with the tutorial
creates symlinks in this directory that point to the actual files
inside the users chrooted home.

The 000_default.conf file creates a default virtual host for all
requests that do not match any known hosts. This points to a 
simple document root that simply says "site not here".
